## PHP > MySQL - Full Refresh

This demo provides you with a template for connecting to your own MySQL database and retrieving new/updated data after a set interval.

### Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. In `db.php`, replace the values for $host, $port, $usernm, $passwd, $dbname, and $query with your MySQL instance info and desired query to run.

3. Upload `index.php` and `db.php` to your web server, or add it to a directory within your Document Root directory of a locally running web server (we recommend [MAMP](http://mamp.info)!)

4. Navigate to `index.php` in your favorite browser.

5. Pick your jaw up off da floor.
